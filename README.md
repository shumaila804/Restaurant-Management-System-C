# Birbal's Kitchen - Automated Ordering System 🍔🥤

A structured C-based automation system designed to manage restaurant operations, including order placement, bill calculation, and persistent data logging.

## 🛡️ Cyber Security Perspective
Even though this is a Programming Fundamentals project, I have focused on:
* [cite_start]**Input Validation:** Implementing checks to prevent program crashes due to unexpected user input[cite: 16, 51].
* [cite_start]**Data Persistence:** Securely logging transaction records into external `.txt` files[cite: 52].
* [cite_start]**Modular Design:** Using functional decomposition to ensure code maintainability and clarity[cite: 39, 41].

## 🚀 Features
* [cite_start]**Interactive Menus:** Organized categories for Main Dishes, Drinks, and Desserts[cite: 14, 30].
* [cite_start]**Automated Billing:** Real-time calculation of individual and total bills with change management[cite: 17, 31].
* [cite_start]**Feedback System:** Collecting and storing user ratings and comments[cite: 18, 24].
* [cite_start]**File Handling:** Saves every order and feedback into `orders.txt` and `feedback.txt` for record-keeping[cite: 25, 33].

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* [cite_start]**Language:** C [cite: 13]
* [cite_start]**Concepts:** Arrays, Loops, File I/O, Modular Programming (Functions), and Switch Cases[cite: 11, 47].

## 📊 Program Logic
The program follows a structured flow from user input to payment processing and finally data logging.
