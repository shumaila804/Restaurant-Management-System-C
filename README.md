# 🍽️ **Birbal’s Kitchen – Restaurant Ordering & Feedback System (C)**

A **console-based Restaurant Ordering and Feedback System** developed in **C** that allows multiple users to place orders, calculate bills, make payments, and submit feedback. The system also saves order and feedback records using file handling.

## ⚙️ **How to Run**

**1️⃣ Clone the Repository**

Clone or download the repository to your local machine: (https://github.com/shumaila804/Restaurant-Management-System-C)
**2️⃣ Compile the Program**

Use a C compiler (like GCC) to compile the source code:

Linux/macOS: gcc pf.c -o pf

Windows: gcc pf.c -o pf.exe

**3️⃣ Run the Executable**

Execute the compiled program to start the system:

Linux/macOS: ./pf

Windows: pf.exe

## 📊 Output & Key Features
The system successfully performs the following operations:
* **Multi-User Orders:** Handles orders for multiple customers in a single session.
* **Dynamic Menu:** Offers Main Dishes, Drinks, and Desserts with size-based pricing.
* **Automated Billing:** Calculates individual totals, processes payments, and returns change.
* **Data Logging:** Automatically saves order details to `orders.txt` and feedback to `feedback.txt`.
* **Customer Feedback:** Includes a rating system and comment section for service evaluation.

## 📌 Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I have reinforced:
* **Modular Programming:** Using separate functions for file management and core logic.
* **Data Handling:** Using arrays for price lists and loops for iterative tasks.
* **Real-world Application:** Building a structured system from pseudocode and flowcharts to a functional product.
